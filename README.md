# 🌸 Flower_Classification_Model

A deep learning-based image classification project that identifies different types of flowers using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) built with TensorFlow and Keras.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project aims to classify flower species using a CNN trained on image data. The model can predict flower types based on uploaded images through a web interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Deep Learning model using TensorFlow & Keras
- Trained `.h5` model included (`Flower_Recog_Model.h5`)
- Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluation
- `app.py` script to deploy model for inference
- Folder structure for `Images`, `Samples`, and `Uploads`
- Easily extendable with more flower classes
